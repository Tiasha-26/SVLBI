## A brief overview on the progress of my Master's project " Concept Study of Radio Interferometry in Space using small Satellites ".

Mapping radio waves differs from conventional methods, such as those relying on the particle nature of electromagnetic waves, like the photoelectric effect. This distinction arises due to the comparatively low energy of radio photons. Therefore, to visualize radio emissions, we rely upon the wave nature of electromagnetic waves, like interference and diffraction.
Image is nothing but a spatial distribution of intensity. So, from the interference of electric fields, generated by electromagnetic waves originating from the source of interest, one can gain insights into the intensity distribution of that source. The above technique is interferometry and since radio waves are involved in this, it is called radio interferometry.
